# expo-build-flags

A module to make feature-flagging easier for expo projects.

_This module is in active development and is not stable or well documented yet._

## Getting Started

`yarn add expo-build-flags`

Add a flags file to the root of your repo in the form of [the test example](test/integration/default-flags.yml), or run `yarn build-flags init`.

Run `yarn build-flags override +secretFeature -newFeature` sometime before your bundle server or build start to generate the runtime typescript module. This path is defined by `mergePath` and you should add it to your project gitignore.

The arguments after the override command are the flags you want to `+` enable or `-` disable. No comparison with the default value is done, so if it's already enabled and you `+enable` it, it's a no-op.

You can run `yarn build-flags ota-override` instead of "override" to do the same but also consider the branch name in two supported CI environments: Github and Gitlab. Use the `ota.branches` array in the flags.yml to setup that matching and branch-based enablement.

### Set Flags in CI & for Static Builds

To set flags for EAS builds, set the `EXPO_BUILD_FLAGS` environment variable in `eas.json` for your profile. This value will be available to the config plugin at build time in EAS when you add it to your `app.json` plugins array:

```diff
{
  "expo": {
+    "plugins": ["expo-build-flags"]
  }
}
```

Using the `EXPO_BUILD_FLAGS` environment variable, the config plugin will:

- add a `<meta-data android:name="EXBuildFlags" />` tag to your AndroidManifest.xml
- add a `EXBuildFlags` array to your Info.plist
- generate the runtime build flags module for your javascript bundle

The variable value is a comma-separated list of flag names you want to enable, ie: `EXPO_BUILD_FLAGS=newFeature,secretFeature`.

### Enable Tree Shaking

To benefit from tree shaking, add the babel plugin to your project's babel config:

```diff
{
  presets: ["babel-preset-expo"],
  plugins: [
+    ["expo-build-flags/babel-plugin", { flagsModule: "./constants/buildFlags.ts" }],
  ],
}
```

The `flagsModule` path must match the runtime `mergePath` in your committed flags.yml file. This plugin replaces the `BuildFlags` imports with the literal boolean values which allows the build pipeline to strip unreachable paths.

### Flagged Autolinking

If your feature relies on native module behaviour, you may want to avoid linking that module if the build flag is off. To do so, specify the absolute name or relative path to the module in the base definition for your flag:

Example for flags.yml definition:

```yaml
flags:
  featureWithNativeStuff:
    value: false
    modules:
      - react-native-device-info
```

In the above example, `react-native-device-info` would be excluded from autolinking. If you want to allow builds to occur on a specific branch, you can specify it:

```yaml
modules:
  - react-native-device-info:
      branch: some-branch-with-build
```

Locally-referenced modules aren't currently supported (until [this 'exclude' exclusion](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/24d5ae5f288013df19ac09a3406c6a507d781ddb/packages/expo-modules-autolinking/src/autolinking/findModules.ts#L52) can be overridden).

## Goals

- [x] allow defining a base set of flags that are available at runtime in one place
- [x] allow for overriding a flag's value locally during development (without having to change the default value committed to source control)
- [x] allow for running OTA updates with the flag on for specific CI branches
- [x] allow for overriding a flag's value for any native build for one-off testing
- [x] allow for referencing flag values in JS
- [ ] allow for referencing flag values from native code on iOS or Android
- [x] allow for tree-shaking of the JS bundle and dead code path elimination
- [x] allow for typescript to see the specific flags available
- [ ] handle autolinking exclusions for react-native modules
- [ ] add metro resolver w/ proxy to surface better flagged autolinking error messages
- [ ] add android integration spec for flagged autolinking
- [ ] doc site & readme cleanup to reference
